# ipynb-cookbook

Sets up an IPython Notebook server using Chef.

Configuration/templating features will be coded towards IPython 1.0.0, which has not been released yet.

# Requirements
 * [Berkshelf][]: `gem install berks`
 * [Vagrant][] 1.2.4 or higher
 * Berkshelf plugin for Vagrant: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf`
 * Omnibus plugin for Vagrant: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus`

# Usage

## Bootstrap VirtualBox

    vagrant up

Once finished, the IPython notebook can be accessed from your host machine (through port forwarding) on 127.0.0.1:9999.

# Attributes

See `attributes/default.rb` for default values. Most values including `:linux_user`, `:linux_group`, and `:service_name` default to `'ipynb'`.

Particularly important parameters for configuration of the notebook are located in `node[:ipynb][:NotebookApp]`.

If you're using the virtualenv recipe, you can either install more to the same virtualenv (`node[:ipynb][:virtenv]`) oradd additional packages to `node[:ipynb][:extra_packages]`.

```

# Recipes

The `default` recipe simply installs (using system packages) IPython Notebook, numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, and all the dependencies for these.

The `simple_launch` recipe creates user and group *ipynb*, creates a spot to store notebooks, and sets up ipython notebook as a service using supervisord.
